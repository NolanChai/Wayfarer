text,start,duration
all right,0.12,2.88
I feel like we've driven into a real,1.26,4.019
life horror film yeah there's no phone,3.0,4.2
signals of course there isn't up here oh,5.279,4.081
my God there's a face on the ceiling,7.2,6.08
what is that why have they done that,9.36,3.92
[Music],13.88,6.04
for over 600 years the more I heads of,17.22,4.44
Easter Island have Loom large over the,19.92,3.359
people of this island a majestic,21.66,4.02
fantastic presence are you trying to,23.279,3.42
convince them that we're in Easter,25.68,3.48
Island uh no well we're in Miyazaki,26.699,4.561
Japan right now and this is wacky,29.16,3.9
weekend wacky weekend,31.26,3.08
[Music],33.06,2.58
[Applause],34.34,3.94
[Music],35.64,5.239
foreign,38.28,5.64
about to go on a road trip across Kyushu,40.879,5.401
too the biggest Onsen town in all Japan,43.92,4.979
Hot Springs oh great I got to go on a,46.28,4.42
bath again on camera that is the essence,48.899,3.421
of one of the weekends Connor and a bath,50.7,3.06
but I've always wanted to go to Bedford,52.32,3.18
and do a video there honestly I do want,53.76,3.42
to see the more eye statues in real life,55.5,3.6
in person in Easter Island some point in,57.18,3.66
the future but these ones are actually,59.1,3.72
approved by the Elders of Easter Island,60.84,3.24
they're giving it the sign off right,62.82,3.119
yeah there's a UNESCO world heritage,64.08,4.079
sign all around here just in your face,65.939,4.441
so it must be good but what I like is,68.159,4.021
the original Maui statues right they,70.38,3.54
were made to commemorate the leaders of,72.18,3.479
the island and the bigger the statue the,73.92,3.059
more important the leader of the island,75.659,3.301
was while they were sort of rolled in on,76.979,5.041
bits of wood by 150 people these ones,78.96,4.56
were shipped in by crane oh there's a,82.02,3.0
big better than being dropped in by,83.52,3.239
crane take some of the magic the,85.02,3.84
Ethereal magic away but anyway we came,86.759,3.841
in for a road trip so what's first on,88.86,3.78
our list then we are going to a,90.6,5.28
beautiful traditional abandoned Village,92.64,6.68
favorite color let's go,95.88,3.44
yazaki is an often overlooked region,100.02,3.48
given it's on the quiet Southeastern,101.88,3.96
coast of Kishi but it's a place that,103.5,4.619
punches well above its way,105.84,4.86
coming up we taste Miyazaki beef Japan's,108.119,4.581
most award-winning World gear,110.7,4.08
desperately attempt to catch our lunch,112.7,4.48
out of a literal drain point which I,114.78,4.32
can't get them in time it's yours it's,117.18,3.299
the most stressful dining experience,119.1,4.08
I've had in 10 years I nearly get tossed,120.479,5.221
overboard by Captain Connor in the,123.18,6.38
ethereal takachi hogi,125.7,3.86
it's road trip North to beppu Hot,131.819,3.361
Springs is all a bit of a smoke screen,133.379,3.661
because the real reason I've planned to,135.18,3.96
take us to Japan's largest onset is it's,137.04,4.38
home to the dinosaur love hotel that,139.14,4.02
I've so sorely wanted to visit for,141.42,3.899
almost a decade imagine Jurassic Park,143.16,4.74
but far sexier Jeff Goldblum blow up,145.319,4.981
dolls for everyone Conor is gonna love,147.9,3.78
it,150.3,3.299
despite being ranked as Japan's happiest,151.68,4.62
prefecture in a survey in 2021 that,153.599,4.681
still hasn't stopped Miyazaki suffering,156.3,4.019
from the same depopulation issues faced,158.28,3.78
by more rural prefectures across the,160.319,4.021
country so desperate is the situation in,162.06,4.259
2020 incredibly the local government,164.34,4.56
offered payments of 1 million yen to,166.319,4.681
entice families to move here but to see,168.9,3.54
where things are heading I found a,171.0,3.239
so-called ghost Village that illustrates,172.44,3.659
this trend although to get to it we've,174.239,3.481
got to drive into one of the most,176.099,3.42
isolated mountain regions in all of,177.72,3.96
Kyushu down a precariously narrow,179.519,4.44
disused road not that I've told our,181.68,4.38
Earth wild driver probably best he,183.959,4.5
doesn't know what lies up ahead,186.06,4.86
I don't know where we're going Chris but,188.459,5.881
if you can see in front of us the roads,190.92,5.28
are so tiny and we're going in the,194.34,3.479
mountains of Kyushu where the [ __ ] are,196.2,3.3
we going Chris I'm glad Conor's driving,197.819,4.441
I'm navigating go straight oh such great,199.5,4.2
navigation Chris what would I do without,202.26,3.059
you oh maybe I could actually focus on,203.7,2.94
driving,205.319,3.241
so we've got more into the mountains and,206.64,3.84
Google is insisting that this is a road,208.56,5.24
but look at this,210.48,3.32
no no,214.58,3.299
oh it's so narrow this is insane I,219.56,5.2
really should have got the full,223.86,3.72
insurance policy it was only another 500,224.76,4.02
years I need a [ __ ] life insurance,227.58,2.879
policy as well,228.78,4.679
changing,230.459,3.0
a game that's one way of wording death,240.36,6.72
it's going to change the Game of Death,245.18,4.0
quite frankly I feel like we've driven,247.08,5.04
into a real-life horror film,249.18,4.559
there's no phone signal because of,252.12,3.24
course there isn't up here so we're fine,253.739,3.18
now so if we actually get in an accident,255.36,4.379
we were genuinely fun no wonder it's,256.919,4.681
[ __ ] abandoned why the [ __ ] would I,259.739,3.96
want to cover this road no one wants to,261.6,4.8
come up here this sucks,263.699,5.401
after 45 minutes driving down something,266.4,5.519
that used to be a road it finally comes,269.1,5.039
to an end in a desolate clearing and so,271.919,4.441
leaving the safety of the car behind we,274.139,5.06
proceed the last kilometer on foot,276.36,4.86
how do you feel about driving back,279.199,4.181
Connor I'm not right you're driving man,281.22,3.66
yeah I would drive up and you would,283.38,3.44
drive down if you've got experience now,284.88,3.96
you've done it you know where the rocks,286.82,3.22
are you know the slight you could do,288.84,3.0
with your eyes shut nope you could drive,290.04,3.9
back I know it's fair don't you think,291.84,4.2
the crystal dry back viewers type yes,293.94,3.72
Chris should drive back time [ __ ] off,296.04,4.04
Connor,297.66,2.42
as we head deeper into the forest,304.699,4.481
suddenly through the dense foliage we,307.139,4.021
spot the outline of a crumbling building,309.18,3.84
on the edge of what was once the village,311.16,4.5
of sabukau,313.02,4.86
which is insane hopefully the Drone,315.66,3.9
shots can give it some sort of context,317.88,3.42
how deep into the mountains we are and,319.56,3.12
the footage of the car going down the,321.3,3.179
road shows you how difficult it was to,322.68,3.48
get here so I just stumble across like a,324.479,3.841
brick wall and what appears to be a town,326.16,4.5
emerging from the woods it's very eerie,328.32,5.9
it's very very eerie indeed,330.66,3.56
definitely not unsettling at all,336.06,4.44
don't know what the meaning is behind it,338.88,3.3
but even if someone's just doing it to,340.5,3.18
play a prank I don't appreciate it you,342.18,3.0
don't have some you know like some,343.68,3.6
berries don't look poisonous this one,345.18,4.799
definitely looks poisonous what is it I,347.28,3.54
don't know I don't know where it's,349.979,4.521
growing from really bizarre,350.82,3.68
Connor's just found his accommodation,354.539,4.081
kind of lost today's challenge shall we,356.94,3.84
put him up in a nice five-star coach,358.62,5.519
it's really unpleasant good God it's odd,360.78,5.34
really looks like it was like a rush to,364.139,4.321
evacuate not really like a slow progress,366.12,4.98
there's so much stuff here,368.46,3.959
to be fair though if you look inside,371.1,2.34
this room,372.419,2.581
it still looks better than Connor's,373.44,3.18
apartment,375.0,3.36
Japan's ghost Villages are rapidly,376.62,3.24
becoming more frequent given the,378.36,3.36
depopulation of the countryside the,379.86,3.6
survey in 2018 revealed there's,381.72,4.08
currently around 8 million empty homes,383.46,4.32
across the country with a rural vacancy,385.8,5.1
rate of 16 the highest in the developed,387.78,4.44
world,390.9,3.78
sabukawa was once home to 200 villagers,392.22,4.44
working perhaps unsurprisingly in,394.68,3.78
forestry as well as the cultivation of,396.66,3.84
shiitake mushrooms by the time it was,398.46,4.62
fully abandoned in 1989 just 13 people,400.5,4.139
lived here and the local government,403.08,3.839
assisted in relocating them to better,404.639,4.201
connected towns but despite being,406.919,3.84
abandoned for over 30 years there's,408.84,3.54
still signs that the former residents,410.759,3.421
occasionally returned to the place they,412.38,3.539
once called home whether it's a cup of,414.18,5.28
fresh sake on the village Shrine or a,415.919,5.701
mysterious chair that looks somewhat out,419.46,3.48
of place,421.62,5.76
oh oh my God,422.94,7.14
so this chair look at the rug it's not,427.38,4.56
stained it's not dirty it actually looks,430.08,3.66
really clean and given where the chair,431.94,4.02
is positioned and where the the rug or,433.74,4.26
carpet is it's almost as if someone's,435.96,3.84
come back here and they just sit down on,438.0,3.599
it casually and remember the good old,439.8,4.92
days and oh my God there's a face on the,441.599,5.82
ceiling in short that's not creepy at,444.72,3.72
all,447.419,3.06
what is that,448.44,4.56
what is that why have they done that all,450.479,3.78
right so that's a bit unsettling I think,453.0,3.9
it's time to go now but Chalk Face clean,454.259,4.801
rug a fishing rod that looks brand new,456.9,4.5
fishing rod right here I feel like,459.06,3.96
someone does come back here and they,461.4,2.94
remember the good old days of coming to,463.02,3.54
school here maybe do you think I'm onto,464.34,4.859
something detective there's no way this,466.56,4.68
rug exists and it's been there for years,469.199,4.021
no it's far too clean someone's either,471.24,3.66
cleaned it or they brought a new one we,473.22,3.479
sent the Drone up a minute ago right and,474.9,3.0
we want to get some shots of the town,476.699,3.301
and the Drone went up over the forest,477.9,4.079
pointed down and you couldn't see,480.0,3.599
anything the only buildings we could see,481.979,3.601
had basically Blended in with the trees,483.599,3.781
right they've become almost a part of,485.58,4.44
the forest it's quite impressive I,487.38,4.08
thought when you said Town it was going,490.02,3.48
to be like three four houses but it,491.46,4.2
seems to me like it was kind of a bit,493.5,4.44
much bigger size than that this sort of,495.66,3.719
thing this is going to be far more,497.94,3.3
common going forward as people move to,499.379,3.781
the cities and leave the countryside,501.24,4.079
behind so you're driving right,503.16,3.599
uh I mean you've got a lot of,505.319,3.801
experiences,506.759,2.361
back to civilization and our next stop,514.5,4.14
is miyazaki's most celebrated attraction,516.539,4.081
the fairy tale backdrop that is,518.64,3.839
takachiho Gorge,520.62,4.26
but before we hop on a boat we're,522.479,4.92
feeling a little bit peckish lucky for,524.88,4.26
us there's a nearby restaurant serving,527.399,3.661
up the local specialty just as the,529.14,4.74
waterfall at takachiho flows so too to,531.06,5.279
our noodles quite literally down a,533.88,4.81
bamboo drain pipe,536.339,5.58
[Music],538.69,3.229
in it,547.279,4.661
so in Japan they've got Sushi conveyor,549.839,4.921
belts what they also have are noodles,551.94,4.68
coming down a pipe,554.76,3.96
and the Little River oh [ __ ],556.62,5.88
got a fight oh my God shut down you,558.72,6.54
messed it all up shut up and then you,562.5,4.32
take the needles off put them in here,565.26,4.56
interception,566.82,3.0
say dear boys what I like is I can stop,570.959,3.901
kind of meeting because I can get to the,573.42,3.24
food first as it gets to me as you'll,574.86,4.26
snatch it out they're not [ __ ] about,576.66,3.56
here,579.12,3.06
this is the most stressful dining,580.22,4.0
experience I've had in 10 years,582.18,4.5
wacky this is wacky in a shirt right I,584.22,4.94
don't like this,586.68,2.48
what I've got a mess this is just too,591.74,4.719
many noodles as well can we stop let's,594.779,3.12
just stop sending noodles this is a,596.459,2.761
cherry this is like survival of the,597.899,3.06
fittest if you can't use chopsticks it's,599.22,3.54
game over you can't you can't eat you,600.959,3.481
just can't have your dinner I will say,602.76,4.259
it's a cool concept but man is it is it,604.44,4.44
not fun it's just you're just kind of,607.019,3.181
like trying to get your food you're like,608.88,2.7
fighting for your life so you don't miss,610.2,1.87
it,611.58,2.9
[Music],612.07,5.449
we're at takachiho Gorge and for lack of,614.48,5.1
a better word it's gorgeous,617.519,4.521
[Music],619.58,4.96
referred to it as Nature's bidet earlier,622.04,4.6
of course you do there's always a toilet,624.54,3.239
analogy somewhere no matter how,626.64,2.699
beautiful no matter how stunning it's,627.779,3.781
always a sodding bidet reference God's,629.339,3.421
Shady,631.56,3.24
with its Steve Cliffs emerald green,632.76,4.56
waters and 17 meter high waterfall it's,634.8,4.44
not hard to see takachi or gorge's,637.32,3.9
appeal even if the noodles leave a lot,639.24,3.84
to be desired and with rental boats at,641.22,3.9
our disposal it's time for us to sail,643.08,4.14
down river to get the money shot of the,645.12,4.26
waterfall but it's not long before I,647.22,4.38
hugely regret my decision to put Captain,649.38,4.98
Connor in charge of our vessel oh well,651.6,5.1
I'm a little bit worried going on a,654.36,4.08
fairly flimsy boat with about five,656.7,3.0
thousand dollars worth of camera,658.44,3.18
equipment I've lost some weight because,659.7,3.18
otherwise it'll be like the [ __ ],661.62,3.959
Titanic going down in the gorge but I,662.88,4.079
think with your ego on board it might,665.579,4.161
happen anyway,666.959,2.781
[Music],670.82,5.74
I got on the back of the boat and it,674.24,4.719
went bumps like that and it felt like I,676.56,3.839
was about to go underwater I'm gonna,678.959,3.301
drive us into the waterfall no you know,680.399,4.801
[ __ ] off I'm driving okay let's get this,682.26,4.16
boat moving,685.2,4.5
slow right now what was supposed to be a,686.42,4.96
relaxing afternoon sailing through a,689.7,3.96
Gorge quickly descends into Terror on,691.38,4.199
the high seas as Connor plowed straight,693.66,4.5
into a bottleneck of half a dozen boats,695.579,4.141
we've got to sail through the [ __ ],698.16,3.66
fifth Fleet to get to the waterfall look,699.72,3.78
at how many boats there are oh my God,701.82,4.44
traffic traffic jam starboard starboard,703.5,6.5
Connor what have you done it's not me,706.26,7.44
this is absolute [ __ ] we're boxed,710.0,5.14
in we can't escape when there's like a,713.7,4.199
[ __ ] waterfall just like drenching me,715.14,7.28
come on Connor yeah,717.899,4.521
all right we're out of the danger zone,723.019,5.5
wow that looks nice we'll leave,725.24,5.32
it seems I spoke too soon about being,728.519,4.141
out of the danger zone as Conor decides,730.56,4.44
to take us airlessly close to the bloody,732.66,3.48
waterfall,735.0,5.66
let's go backwards shall we go,736.14,4.52
there's a lot of equipment here,740.839,4.201
he's getting scared yet Chris you,746.3,5.159
[ __ ],749.1,2.359
absolutely [ __ ] went straight into,757.399,4.241
the waterfall,760.38,3.6
nothing about this is romantic this is,761.64,5.72
like a magic I have to say,763.98,3.38
having survived Conor's treachery we,768.2,4.18
hastily escape to our nearby,770.94,3.42
accommodation a traditional Inn on the,772.38,6.3
outskirts of takachiho time to dry off,774.36,6.599
so guys we've just arrived in takachi or,778.68,4.86
home to Japan's most famous Gorge and,780.959,4.68
this is where we're staying tonight this,783.54,4.02
most beautiful kind of like a house it's,785.639,4.26
a yorkan traditional Inn but you get,787.56,4.56
your own little house with a bath and,789.899,5.281
various amenities and uh Connor who's in,792.12,6.36
here is going to give us the Grand Tour,795.18,5.52
Little Pigs Little Pigs,798.48,5.58
open up sorry you there's nothing enough,800.7,4.699
to be here,804.06,3.56
establishment I'm sorry,805.399,5.141
this is quite frankly one of the best,807.62,4.42
real cans I've ever stayed this is one,810.54,3.299
of the nicer we've done a fair few lucky,812.04,3.18
weekend let's start with the best part,813.839,4.201
of all right,815.22,6.559
why is it good you might ask what's this,818.04,3.739
it's great yeah,822.48,5.7
I just refuse to lift light plastic you,824.24,5.44
will never catch me lifting what I like,828.18,3.12
is this Beauty and the Beast it's like,829.68,3.719
when the petals full Connor will turn,831.3,4.76
into the Beast,833.399,2.661
The Petal Falls Chris will finally,836.18,4.839
upload a video should we start in the,838.38,4.86
domain room start with the Moon,841.019,4.981
so right away you'll notice really,843.24,5.58
really big ceiling for real car this is,846.0,4.68
quite rare I mean I I noticed that,848.82,3.66
you're like wow also amazing view of,850.68,3.659
course it's got a bit of a keto vibe to,852.48,3.539
it isn't it yeah the sort of the patio,854.339,3.841
where you can sit here and enjoy the,856.019,3.901
view I mean the whole point of coming to,858.18,3.48
real cam is to relax right maybe you've,859.92,2.88
got a partner maybe you know you just,861.66,2.76
want to get away for the weekend and you,862.8,3.12
know typically you spend one night so,864.42,3.659
this is kind of the perfect Tranquility,865.92,3.9
that you want to get away from it all,868.079,4.021
get away from the Tokyo City Life Sendai,869.82,3.959
you know absolutely they've done such a,872.1,3.359
good job incorporating like the outside,873.779,4.081
nature into the room so not only have we,875.459,3.601
got the door there but like this window,877.86,3.599
this Shorty sliding Dive by the beds you,879.06,3.839
can see the leaves and the trees the,881.459,3.421
sort of the Shadows dancing in the,882.899,3.781
window it's beautiful really nice room,884.88,3.66
we've seen the main room we've seen the,886.68,3.719
bathroom and now it's time to see the,888.54,3.5
wet room,890.399,3.721
they've spared no expense in this,892.04,3.58
changing room mate look they've got the,894.12,4.26
Dyson Mega [ __ ] hair dryer from the,895.62,5.399
future as well so that's pretty cool but,898.38,4.5
from the changing room you go down these,901.019,4.38
stairs and in to the shower room,902.88,6.36
with a staggering number of uh options,905.399,6.24
in above,909.24,3.42
and,911.639,3.241
side and once you've washed you come,912.66,3.96
into the bath to see,914.88,4.399
a horror show okay,916.62,5.459
we sit inside a bath like this what do,919.279,5.201
you what do you feel what do you think,922.079,4.081
tranquility,924.48,5.94
Perfection this is the best bat,926.16,7.59
[Music],930.42,3.33
VA we really do,936.98,4.539
let's get him splashing about I have to,939.42,5.0
get naked on camera,941.519,2.901
if I watched Chris,944.66,5.44
if I must people would break their own,947.339,4.62
fingers to sit in that bathtub wraps in,950.1,3.72
a towel looking at this wonderful garden,951.959,3.841
to break all the bones to try and get,953.82,4.1
out of here of what,955.8,4.27
right off to dinner,957.92,5.02
[Music],960.07,4.97
to dinner at the end with miyazaki's,962.94,4.259
award-winning wagy beef on the menu but,965.04,4.02
is it worthy of the hype it's an,967.199,3.841
investigation I'm willing to undertake,969.06,4.019
gosh the sacrifices I make for this,971.04,4.68
channel so guys it's dinner time and,973.079,4.801
they've just bought out Sebastian the,975.72,4.679
crowd uh or Ralph Sebastian the lobster,977.88,4.199
look at the size of that Conor's having,980.399,4.141
a feast of Sashimi before the main event,982.079,4.921
before the Miyazaki beef comes out so,984.54,5.039
I've never ever had Lobster Sashimi,987.0,4.32
before this is the spinal Lobster not,989.579,2.76
the normal Lobster so I don't know if,991.32,2.22
that makes it different but let's give,992.339,2.711
it a shot,993.54,3.2
[Music],995.05,3.95
that actually surprisingly works it,996.74,3.459
still kind of has that Lobster meat,999.0,3.48
flavor but kind of more subdued that's,1000.199,4.26
really nice you'll like this yeah so,1002.48,4.08
apparently a Nobel prize-winning party,1004.459,4.38
came to this your con and this is the,1006.56,4.38
menu they had and this is the very,1008.839,6.461
Lobster they dined on let's dive in,1010.94,6.44
[Music],1015.3,4.0
yeah,1017.38,4.6
it's not bad I don't it's probably my,1019.3,4.479
thing it's a bit too,1021.98,3.599
chewy and,1023.779,3.721
don't use the word slimy because slimy,1025.579,4.561
sounds bad I judge a Leo Khan meal by,1027.5,4.26
the Sashimi by the quality of the fish,1030.14,3.36
this is really fresh this is really good,1031.76,3.299
sign,1033.5,4.319
foreign,1035.059,5.85
[Music],1037.819,3.09
I'm just thinking like I normally don't,1044.62,3.819
care about like fancy food I'm like,1046.699,3.841
whatever I'll take a Big Mac but this is,1048.439,5.041
like another level I I think this might,1050.54,4.56
be the best beef I've ever had in my,1053.48,3.78
life really so every five years in Japan,1055.1,4.5
I have the wagyu Olympics right will I,1057.26,4.799
have a contest for all the wagyu Cuts,1059.6,4.5
around Japan like Corby matizaka,1062.059,4.86
meizower and for a 15-year period this,1064.1,5.4
was the winner it's also been served at,1066.919,6.421
the Academy Awards let's find out why,1069.5,6.799
let's get it right and now we know why,1073.34,5.699
oh this is the right balance between,1076.299,5.861
being fatty but also juicy and kind of,1079.039,6.841
meaty like a western cuts,1082.16,6.24
that's so damn good before we came in,1085.88,4.32
they gave us a menu asking do you want,1088.4,3.42
more beef when your course comes we were,1090.2,2.88
like we'll be right,1091.82,3.18
we [ __ ] up we should have been like,1093.08,3.3
yeah bring us all the people just bring,1095.0,2.66
in everything,1096.38,3.72
let's get this done can you imagine when,1097.66,3.879
the Nobel Prize but as well sat around,1100.1,3.62
here and they were like this is the beef,1101.539,6.981
so no I want that [ __ ] Nobel Prize,1103.72,4.8
the next morning we leave takachiho,1109.1,3.9
Gorge behind to continue our journey two,1111.14,3.84
hours North to Japan's largest hot,1113.0,5.34
spring town of beppu so takachiho Gorge,1114.98,5.579
wasn't verdict really beautiful I mean,1118.34,3.78
it deserves all the praise it gets,1120.559,4.021
obvious why so many tourists go there to,1122.12,4.62
soak their friends underneath a massive,1124.58,3.78
waterfall hey I think you've got a once,1126.74,3.0
in a lifetime experience there you're,1128.36,2.819
not nearly blowing up all my equipment,1129.74,4.319
Connor's like this is a joke if I was,1131.179,4.261
the other way around it was Connor's,1134.059,3.181
camera equipment he would be having a,1135.44,4.619
[ __ ] field day on the cycling every,1137.24,5.28
wacky weekend fun fact bit of Insider,1140.059,4.381
info we use my cameras for wacky weekend,1142.52,3.24
because Connor hasn't bought any good,1144.44,3.119
cameras but anyway we're on our way to,1145.76,3.419
bathroom now and um it's a beautiful,1147.559,3.36
drive ahead as we go through the,1149.179,3.961
countryside from Miyazaki across near,1150.919,4.861
Mount asso too much volcanoes and into,1153.14,5.399
uh oyster perfect chair Tibet,1155.78,6.0
pepper has an insane 2 900 hot spring,1158.539,5.88
vents 10 of the total in all of Japan,1161.78,5.88
pumping out an estimated 130 million,1164.419,5.88
liters of hot water every single day and,1167.66,4.139
though much of that water heads to the,1170.299,3.181
local Inns and hotels around the city,1171.799,3.481
the hottest Springs are known as the,1173.48,4.02
hells of pepper steamy otherworldly,1175.28,3.899
spots each with their own striking,1177.5,3.48
colors and appearances as a result of,1179.179,3.541
the varying minerals flowing from the,1180.98,3.36
springs,1182.72,3.72
so guys we made it to Pepper it's such,1184.34,3.54
an incredible city as you come over the,1186.44,4.44
hill you see the town below and all the,1187.88,5.159
steam emanating from across the entire,1190.88,4.32
city Beppo is built on one of the most,1193.039,4.5
seismically active areas in kyushi and,1195.2,3.9
the whole city has eight different Hills,1197.539,4.14
across it called and this is one of them,1199.1,6.14
the Umi jigoku literally Umi means,1201.679,6.901
hell that sounds kind of weird but you,1205.24,4.6
can see why with the color that bright,1208.58,3.36
blue cobalt blue that's because there is,1209.84,4.02
a lot of cobalt minerals in it and some,1211.94,3.0
of the other pools are different,1213.86,2.64
striking colors there's one over there,1214.94,3.239
looks like a [ __ ] bloodbath but it's,1216.5,3.66
just filled with iron so don't worry and,1218.179,3.421
one thing I will say that is pretty cool,1220.16,3.54
but I haven't seen this before is just,1221.6,4.68
how like violently the water is being,1223.7,4.92
ejected from over there I don't know if,1226.28,3.72
that's man-made or if that's natural,1228.62,3.059
that's natural it's natural that's,1230.0,3.48
insane how do they do that just draw,1231.679,3.481
like the tiniest hole and then just let,1233.48,4.02
it come out that's awesome but yeah I,1235.16,4.2
really want to swim in it really get,1237.5,4.55
inside come on get that jacket off,1239.36,5.04
[Laughter],1242.05,5.17
so this one is called the red Pond and,1244.4,3.96
it looks a little bit like Connor's,1247.22,2.94
bathtub after Conor comes out of it,1248.36,3.92
right now,1250.16,4.32
this is what it looks like,1252.28,4.84
well why is it red why is it red yeah,1254.48,5.4
the minerals minerals what [ __ ] well,1257.12,4.02
I know someone [ __ ] hid the evidence,1259.88,3.06
of the last person they murdered too,1261.14,2.82
fair if you were gonna get rid of,1262.94,3.479
someone Joe gadani this looks like,1263.96,4.2
someone dumped a bunch of Cocoa Puffs in,1266.419,3.961
an onset and forgot to take them out she,1268.16,4.68
turned round bring a big spine it,1270.38,4.08
weirdly does look man-made if you told,1272.84,3.06
me this is from like a Disney theme park,1274.46,3.36
I'd be like wow the theming is on point,1275.9,4.44
with this action it looks awesome good,1277.82,4.56
job good job Disney,1280.34,3.6
Connor's got an obsession with this,1282.38,3.419
Tanuki,1283.94,3.599
why do you like him so much,1285.799,2.941
I know there's some cultural,1287.539,3.361
significance to it but,1288.74,4.22
I wanted to look like that,1290.9,5.94
POV regrets wiping left on Timber,1292.96,6.099
One Thing Worth noticing I don't know if,1296.84,3.78
it's because we've been here for too,1299.059,4.201
long this one doesn't smell I don't,1300.62,4.439
notice that this one doesn't smell like,1303.26,3.84
the typical kind of eggy sulfur smell,1305.059,3.721
that the other one did the iron one,1307.1,4.079
absolutely stunned it's the sound that's,1308.78,3.899
quite ominous it sounds almost like a,1311.179,3.36
jet plane taking off right the jet,1312.679,3.721
turbine and that's the ferocity of the,1314.539,3.781
wards are blasting out from beneath the,1316.4,4.74
earth's surface honestly this is when,1318.32,4.859
the few times I don't mind wearing a,1321.14,4.62
mask outside when one of those sulfuric,1323.179,4.74
plumes hits you in the face it's,1325.76,5.46
anything but Pleasant oh,1327.919,5.581
yes probably a good thing Conor's not,1331.22,4.14
jumping in giving these sizzling Springs,1333.5,4.5
pumped up from 200 meters below are,1335.36,5.58
between 60 to 80 degrees Celsius let's,1338.0,7.26
keep boiled sea dog off the menu for now,1340.94,6.599
so guys we are absolutely stunning,1345.26,4.5
ryokan in bepu it's been an amazing trip,1347.539,4.38
because it is so big and the room is so,1349.76,3.779
ridiculous we've got a dedicated video,1351.919,3.481
to that over on the Chris broad chance,1353.539,3.301
go and check that out but before you,1355.4,3.12
could enjoy the many baths in this room,1356.84,3.9
and there are many to enjoy we're gonna,1358.52,4.32
go to some of my very special indeed,1360.74,4.799
somewhere that bepu as only bepu has and,1362.84,4.38
that why is it like a dungeon where I,1365.539,4.201
die it is a dinosaur love Hotel there's,1367.22,4.26
one thing though okay because this is,1369.74,4.2
such an integral part to this video we,1371.48,4.559
cannot allow failure to happen now you,1373.94,3.78
might recall last time we did a love,1376.039,3.661
Hotel video in Osaka we actually,1377.72,3.54
couldn't get in it right yeah because,1379.7,3.24

kind of tame almost in comparison can't,1631.76,4.98
leave my wig here no can I put it in the,1633.98,4.799
trash so we're checking out right we,1636.74,3.419
have two buttons here one's yorking,1638.779,4.14
coconut bottom bottle which tells us how,1640.159,7.461
much we owe and we owe an astonishing,1642.919,8.341
5350 bit pricey for the uh the 45,1647.62,5.559
minutes of fun we've had here but this,1651.26,3.539
is something I've never seen before,1653.179,4.201
we've got to pay the fee usually they,1654.799,4.321
have like a like a machine almost like a,1657.38,4.2
vending machine right this is a vacuum,1659.12,5.159
tube you put the money in here press the,1661.58,5.16
button it shoots off like a something,1664.279,5.581
out of a 1980s movie and that's how this,1666.74,6.179
works so right now as in every love,1669.86,4.559
Hotel you get locked in the room right,1672.919,3.781
until you pay it's quite claustrophobic,1674.419,4.981
and scary so providing the vacuum tube,1676.7,5.52
goes all right to the cashier person the,1679.4,4.2
door should like unlock at some point,1682.22,3.54
have you ever seen this before you seem,1683.6,4.8
like this is normal this is so old and,1685.76,5.039
Dusty I don't know all right give us the,1688.4,4.08
money we're getting the phone out of it,1690.799,4.98
look at that that's asbestos this is I,1692.48,5.34
can't believe this this is some badass,1695.779,3.541
technology is it just like Jurassic Park,1697.82,3.66

love hotels and I've always wanted to,1725.6,3.36
come here let's face it I'm fairly,1726.919,4.62
disappointing I mean you can't lie the,1728.96,3.959
animatronics in the front are pretty,1731.539,3.781
cool but that's kind of weird yeah yeah,1732.919,3.901
all the stuff coming in was pretty epic,1735.32,3.18
but the room itself was pretty standard,1736.82,3.18
and a little bit underwhelming a bit,1738.5,3.6
like the the recent Jurassic Park movies,1740.0,6.539
themselves all showing no no do you,1742.1,5.819
recognize people come here and reenact,1746.539,3.601
